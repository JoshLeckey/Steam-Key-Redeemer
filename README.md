## FAQ

#### Is this safe

Yes, all the program does is automate a browser. It does require you to be logged into steam, however once the program has stopped your details are deleted. This program also runs locally, so all data is stored on your machine.

#### Can i get banned for this

No, the program just automates an input by a user, so this is 100% safe
